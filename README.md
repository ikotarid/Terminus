# Terminus
Terminus was developed on Open Source QGIS software. It is a fast and easy to use plugin that allows users to implement image segmentation on Remote Sensing data.
Image segmentation is the initial and integral procedure to produce the fundamental elements of OBIA. It is about the partitioning of an image into spatially adjoining and homogenous regions (segments) that form the foundation for further analysis. Terminus includes four popular image segmentation algorithms: felzenszwalb, quickshift, slic and watershed.
